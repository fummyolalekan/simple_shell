.SH NAME

.B simple_shell - hsh
- command line interpreter or shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B  ./hsh
.I (no options included as of this writing (August 14, 2021))

.SH DESCRIPTION

simple_shell, is a custom implementation of a simple UNIX shell. A minimalistic approach was taken in its design and implementation to only provide the basic functions of a shell similar to the one designed by the pioneer of UNIX shells, Ken Thompson. Design, compilation, and testing was done on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

.SH OVERVIEW

Similar to other legendary command line interfaces, the simple_shell takes input from either the terminal or scripts and executes them as they appear.


.SH INVOCATION

The GNU Compiler Collection, gcc, is recommended for compiling simple_shell with extra flags as shown.
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
In interactive mode, the simple_shell works by taking user input on the terminal after pressing the enter key. Note that the prompt ('$') will appear and you will then be in interactive mode and able to enter commands followed by "enter."
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE
In non-interactive mode, users can specify shell scripts to be executed by simple_shell usually through the use of pipes '|'.
.P
.RS
.B echo 'pwd' | ./hsh

.SH EXECUTABLES

Example of executables:
.IP
.br
.\&
.RS
\&$ echo "Example of executables"
.br
\&"Example of executables"
.br
\&$

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell 
is a command language interpreter 
that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

.SH ARGUMENTS
If arguments remain after option processing the first argument 
is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands.
simple_shell reads and executes commands from this file, then exit.
simple_shell exit status is the exit status of the last command executed
 in the script. If not commands are executed, the exit status is '\n'.
The executed files are always found in the PATH.

.SH SIMPLE_SHELL GRAMMAR
.B Simple Commands
A simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by
blank-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control operator.
The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as
argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked
command.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple
command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.

.SH EXAMPLES

ls /directory/directory
